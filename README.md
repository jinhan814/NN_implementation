# NN_implementation

‚úè Multi-Layer Neural Network Implementation

- Line-by-line implementation of multi-layer feed forward neural networks with back propagation.

- All code is based on ["Neural Networks and Deep Learning"](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning) by Michael Nielsen.

## Version

- NN_v1 : MLP implemented by Python & Numpy (Sigmoid, MSE, No opt)

- NN_v2 : Improve performance from NN_v1 (ReLU, CrossEntropy, He, L2, ...)

## Update Note

- 21-08-16 : add NN.v1

- 21-08-18 : add NN.v2
