# NN_implementation

‚úè Multi-Layer Neural Network Implementation

- Line-by-line implementation of multi-layer feed forward neural networks with back propagation.

- All code is based on ["Neural Networks and Deep Learning"](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning) by Michael Nielsen.

## Version

- NN_v1 : MLP implemented by Python & Numpy

- NN_v2 : Handwritten Digits Classification implemented by c++

## Update Note

- 21-08-16 : add NN.v1

- 21-08-17 : add NN.v2
